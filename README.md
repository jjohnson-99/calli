# calli

**Note! This code currently adds nothing to existing code, please don't think
I'm  passing it along as my own work.** I plan to eventually modify and expand
on it. The repo will be made private if I abandon it before making significant
changes to it.


First thing first, I have no clue what I'm doing. This is a project intended to
hopefully teach me a little bit about a lot of things. Calli is a simple text
editor based on snaptoken's [instructional
booklet](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) implementing
antirez's [kilo](https://antirez.com/news/108) text editor. In its current
state, calli is no different than snaptoken's code as I am still working
through kilo.

Why am I doing this? Because I like neovim and want to see how text editors.

How will it be different than kilo? I don't know at the moment.

Where does the name come from? It's named after my late cat Calli, who's name
is based on Calliope, a prominent Greek Muse of epic poetry and eloquence in
Greek Mythology.


# Issues

  ways?
